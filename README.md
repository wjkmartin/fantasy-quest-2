# ~ Fantasy Quest 2 ~ 
### A web RPG built with React and Redux Toolkit. 

A classic sword ‚öî and sorcery üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è experience! Where is Fantasy Quest 1? It's archived! ...and not worth playing.

Try it here: https://fantasy-quest-game.herokuapp.com/ - If it doesn't load at first, please just reload as the free dyno needs a second to wake up.

Desktop only - 1080p resolution and up because I haven't reached the point where I want to spend the time to optimize for resolution-ly challenged.  

Currently looks best with chrome - other browser support will be added later. Sorry, no mobile for now, maybe ever. There's a lot of buttons, ok?

## What can you currently do in the game?
* Navigate through a fantasy world using the minimap in the bottom left. Each icon represents a different location. 
* Equip and unequip items, trade them with select NPCs (the ones that want to buy them), and find items drom monster drops. 
* Fight for your life against ennumerable foes! Or fight for honor and bragging rights by challenging NPCs to duels.
* Level up and increase your stats, if you kill enough monsters.
* Delve into one of two dungeons for loot and glory- the goblin burrow in the fields west of the city, and the rank sewers found near the starting location.
* Pick rare herbs for profit and fun! 
* Recieve one of several different temporary blessings from the local cleric of Rolep, if you can afford it.
* ... and much more!
